# Electronic-Sales-Data-Analysis

## Objective
In this project we use Python Pandas & Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer some Business releated Questions for 12 months worth of sales data. The data contains hundreds of thousands of Electronics Store Sales purchases data broken down by Month, Product Type, Cost, Purchase Address, etc.

We start by cleaning our data. Tasks during this section include:

    Task 1:- Drop NaN values from DataFrame
    Task 2:- Removing rows based on a condition
    Task 3:- Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)

We will be solving 5 Business releated Questions to our data:

    Question 1:- What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
    Question 2:- What city sold the most product?
    Question 3:- What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
    Question 4:- What products are most often sold together?
    Question 5:- What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?

To answer these questions we have to go through many different tasks using Pandas & Matplotlib methods. They include:

    Task 1:- Concatenating multiple csvs together to create a new DataFrame (pd.concat)
    Task 2:- Adding columns
    Task 3:- Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str)
    Task 4:- Using the .apply() method
    Task 5:- Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis
    Task 6:- Plotting bar charts and lines graphs to visualize our results
    Task 7:- Labeling our graphs
